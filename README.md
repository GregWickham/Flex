# Flex - A Controlled Combinatorial Explosion of Language

Flex creates specifications of English grammatical elements, which can be permuted to generate text that expresses an idea in a variety of ways.

Flex is built on top of [Echo](https://github.com/GregWickham/Echo), so you may want to review the [Echo documentation](https://gregwickham.github.io/Echo/) before proceeding.

For documentation, please refer to the Flex project site.
